# `createGenerator` function

Function for setting up some of the [generators OpenAPI provides](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/generators)

## Example

```nix
createGenerator {
    generatorName = "cpp-qt-client";
    binaryOverrides = { src, ... } : {
        nativeBuildInputs = with pkgs; [ cmake libsForQt5.wrapQtAppsHook ];
        buildInputs = with pkgs; [ libsForQt5.qtbase ];
        src = "${src}/client";
    };
}
```

## Returns

A value of type [`Generator`](../types/generator.md)

## Arguments

### `generatorName`

Required

Name of the generator as written on [https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/generators](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/generators)

### `dontBuildBinarReason`

Optional, by default `null`

If this is set to `null` or not set, the generator will have a working `binary` field, which represents a compiled source generated by the OpenAPI ge-nerator.\
If you set this to a string, this will be disabled and evaluating the `binary` field will throw an error containing that string. You should put there an explanation why you don't support building from the source.

**Example from `rust`:**

```nix
dontBuildBinaryReason = ''
    Rust libraries are almost always built from source by the user - Rust libraries are not often obtained as binaries.
    You should use the generated source instead.
'';
```

### `binaryOverrides`

Optional, by default `{ ... }: {}`

Function returning attributes to be passed to `mkDerivation` when building the library from source.

Some fields, such as `name` and `source` is alreay prefilled (though you can override them). Some other might be added in the future.It gets theese _default_ attributes as an argument.

**Example from `cpp-qt-client`:**

```nix
binaryOverrides = { src, ... } : {
    nativeBuildInputs = with pkgs; [ cmake libsForQt5.wrapQtAppsHook ];
    buildInputs = with pkgs; [ libsForQt5.qtbase ];
    src = "${src}/client";
};
```

### `binaryBuilder`

Optional, by default `pkgs.stdenv.mkDerivation`

Function for building the resulting library binary instead of the classic `mkDerivation`
