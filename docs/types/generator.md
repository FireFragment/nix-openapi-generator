# Type `Generator`

Corresponds to one of the generators listed [here on OpenAPI generator website](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/generators). This is returned by the [`createGenerator`](../members/createGenerator.md) function.

It's a function taking an OpenAPI spec and returning the generated source code and compiled binary if supported.

## Returns

It returns an attrset with following fields:

 - `generatorName` - Name of the generator used as listend on the [OpenAPI generator website](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/generators)
 - `sourceCode` - Source code generated by the OpenAPI generator.
 - `binary` - If supported, this is derivation corresponding to the compiled binary. Otherwise, it will throw an error, so you might want to check, that `dontBuildBinaryReason == null`.
 - `dontBuildBinaryReason` - If `binary` is available, this will be `null`. If it's not, it's a string with an explanation why it isn't available.

## Arguments

**Example:**

```nix
generator {
    specification = pkgs.fetchurl {
        url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/9df68a1dafd467d9fdbf68653f351b860b4ec6e5/examples/v3.0/petstore.yaml";
        sha256 = "sha256-WYE2y5BOF+ju6tUa4z3Y1AH9/0VdLXTzhpxKpfJ0ImY=";
    };
};
```

### `specification`

A derivation being a file containing an OpenAPI specification.
